                Who am I? A problem-solver at heart, blending the sharp skills
                of an anticorrosion engineer with the creative edge of a
                JavaScript and React developer. But I don’t stop there—I'm also
                a t-shirt designer with a flair for bold, thought-provoking
                visuals that get people talking. My mission? To push boundaries,
                whether I’m coding clean, efficient web applications or creating
                designs that challenge the status quo. What sets me apart? My
                diverse skill set. I’m not just an engineer. I’m also a
                YouTuber, building a channel to spark conversations about ADHD
                and mental health, inspiring resilience and growth. And did I
                mention? I'm into combat sports, fitness, and all things manga
                and anime—fueling my drive to always level up. Ready to
                innovate? Let’s make something unforgettable—whether it’s
                building software that works or designs that speak.
